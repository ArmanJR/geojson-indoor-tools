```
python3 features-inside-area.py
```

### Add polygons heights

Adds multiple properties to polygons: `level`, `height`, `base_height` and a random `color`.

```
python3 add-polygon-heights.py
```

## Rooms to walls

Create walls for any polygon room. You can adjust the wall thickness with `zeta`. It also sets `height` so walls are differentiable from the original room polygon.
